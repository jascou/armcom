# List of things to do for Armoured Commander

## Bugs to investigate
- Fix no effect on advancing fire

## Improvements
### Gameplay and content
- Default starting load for tanks (HE, AP...)
- Shortcut to fire AP or HE (eg SHIFT-A and SHIFT-E)
  - Adjusts next reloaded shell
  - Put reloader in "change load" mode if needed
  - Reload from rack if more than zero shell of type in rack
- Add air burst against infantry in wood
- Infantry can be dug in trenches
- Reduce chances of being targeted early in the campaign
- Modify enemy type rarity as a function of terrain
- Difficulty settings (Veterant, Regular, Reserve)
- Possibility to save multiple campaigns (one per campaign type?)
- More campaigns (Russian...)
- More diversity of enemies
- More tank variants
- Replacement crew may already have some skills
- Show enemy ascii image in description
  
### UI improvements
- **Consistency (ESC, ENTER, SPACE...)**
- Add control key to toggle sound (F7/7)
- Default start actions of crew to accomodate Fire Main Gun
- Add Quick Start Guide section in first screen and in top menu
- Mouse less mode
  - Examine enemy units without mouse
  - Anything else?
  
### Game and installation
- Include pygame and bsddb? (seems big)
- Maintain Windows and OSX executables
  
### Manual
- Update Manual
- Find best place and format to host manual
- Write a quick start guide
- Write installation section

## Later but probably better left alone
- remove "is not None" and such

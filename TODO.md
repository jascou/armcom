# List of things to do for Armoured Commander

## Bugs to investigate
- Using MGs doesn't auto-select target in active quadrant
- Encounter does not end if no enemy units left but MGs left to fire
- Prevent dead crews from getting promotions or levels
- Units can spawn in the same exact location
- When killing PopUp with "Enter", sends "Enter" to previous screen too

- **Difficulty settings (Veterant, Regular, Reserve)**
- Add air burst against infantry in wood
- Infantry can be dug in trenches (different then ||x|| ?)
- Possibility to save multiple campaigns (one per campaign type?)

## UI improvements
- Mouse less mode
  - Examine enemy units without mouse
  - Anything else?
- Default starting load for tanks (AP)

  succeptible to (AP, HE, HVAP, machine gun...)
